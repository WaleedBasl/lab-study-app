# Step 2: Check your environment

> **Summary:**
> In this step, you'll verify that your environment is set up correctly by running a test script. The script checks your application structure, validates your GitHub token, tests connectivity to the AI service, and confirms that all dependencies are installed.

The `test_setup.py` script is a diagnostic tool that performs a series of checks to ensure your environment is correctly configured. Specifically, it:

* **Checks the application structure**: Confirms that all necessary files are present (e.g., `app/main.py`, `app/services/github_client.py`).
* **Validates the GitHub token**: Looks for the `GITHUB_TOKEN` variable in your `.env` file and ensures it is set.
* **Tests connectivity to the AI service**: Sends a test request to the GitHub AI models service using your token to verify service access and permissions.
* **Confirms dependencies**: Verifies that all required Python libraries are installed.

## ‚å®Ô∏è Activity: Test Your Configuration

1. Before running the test, you need to implement the `check_dependencies` function to verify all required packages are installed. Open the file `test_setup.py`, then in the **Copilot Chat** panel and select the **Edit** mode.

2. Ask Copilot to update the function:

  > ```prompt
  > Update the check_dependencies function to read the packages from requirements.txt and attempt to import each one. Print "‚úÖ Dependencies imported successfully" in the final results list when all dependencies are installed. If any are missing, list the missing packages.
  > ```

3. Review the implementation to ensure it correctly verifies all dependencies from the requirements.txt file.

4. Open your terminal and verify your setup by running:

```bash
python test_setup.py
```

**Expected result:**

```text
‚úÖ Application structure verified
‚úÖ GITHUB_TOKEN found
‚úÖ GitHub Models working - Response: OK  
‚úÖ Dependencies imported successfully
üéâ Setup complete! Everything ready to run the application.
```

1. **GitHub token issues:**

   * Ensure it is copied correctly (no extra spaces)
   * Confirm the `read:user` scope is enabled
   * Use a classic token, not fine-grained

2. **Dependency errors:**

```bash
# Update pip
python -m pip install --upgrade pip

# Reinstall dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Python not found locally:**

   * Windows: Install from [python.org](https://python.org)
   * Ensure Python version is 3.9 or higher
